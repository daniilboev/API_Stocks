# API_Stocks

This repository contains four applications, which are for my personal use:

1) MAIN_EU - Code for the analysis of the Europe sample (contains remarks)
2) MAIN_US - Code for the analysis of the US sample
3) Data - Contains .csv files with data used
4) API Stock Screener - Stock Screener for stocks used in analysis

Code use requires API key from the FMP (https://site.financialmodelingprep.com/developer/docs)
